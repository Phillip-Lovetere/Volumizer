# Volumizer
A repository for the source code of the Volumizer android app, uploaded to google play in 2016

This undertaking spanned approximately 3 months over the summer of 2016, in which I(Phillip Lovetere) taught myself Android software
development using Android Studio and the book 'Head First Android Programming'(highly recommended, by the way) while integrating what 
I already knew with respect to database management via SQL and updating my understanding of HTML to that of XML. 

Volumizer, as intended, automatically changes the volume of whichever music track you're playing on any offline music player you want, 
provided the tracks are all in the same set folder on your phone(which can be changed from the settings). The relative volume levels 
themselves are associated with the filename of each track, as there was no intent broadcast at the time of development indicating switching 
from one audio track to another(as there would be no reason for one). 


If you're looking for the heart of this whole project, I'd recommend looking in VolumeTweakerRunner()
